Project 3 front-end

A work in Progress.
The idea of this app is to create a fun environment to collaborate on work.
It's a messageboard of sorts, where parties involved can see what's to-do, and take on duties.
Technologies used: MERN
Approach: simple, playful, interface driven
Next steps: many more interactive elements to make this app what it set out to be. Users still need to be able to take on tasks and have a better way of adding to those posted.

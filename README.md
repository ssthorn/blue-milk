Project 3: "TaskApp" front-end.

*Work in progress.

A fairly basic to-do type app, the idea being to create a fun environment to collaborate on tasks.  It's a messageboard of sorts, where parties involved can see a list of tasks, and take on duties.  This project is an exercise to learn working in the MERN stack, and employs the 7 RESTful routes.

Technologies used: MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js.  

Approach: Simple and playful.  Included is a fun function to generate random colors for the users and posts.

Next steps: Many more interactive elements will be developed to make this app what it set out to be. Users still need to be able to take on tasks and have a better way of adding to those posted.  I think ultimately the colors should correspond between the user and the tasks they have taken on.  There are some pieces unused code in here that will be used to devlop user login and validation.
